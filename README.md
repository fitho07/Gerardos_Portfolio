### 🛒 **[Urban Mobility and Economic Productivity in LATAM Cities | Triple Ten 2026](https://github.com/FithoGerardo/Urban-Mobility-in-LATAM-Cities/tree/main):**
To identify which cities to invest in transportation infrastructure in order to improve productivity and population well-being.

* *Objective*: To identify which cities to invest in transportation infrastructure in order to improve productivity and population well-being.
* *Data*: A unique, curated dataset was built from two different sources, applying data cleaning, standardization, and validation processes to heterogeneous variables.
* *Techniques*: Data manipulation and analysis using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL queries, and descriptive statistics; process documentation in Jupyter Notebook with visualizations and an executive report.
* *Result*: It was demonstrated that there is no simple linear correlation between a city’s GDP per capita and its level of vehicular traffic, which made it possible to rethink investment criteria toward variables more relevant for public decision-making.
